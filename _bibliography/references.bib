  abstract = {Abstract In this study, we analyzed students’ reasoning and explanations of friction concepts before and after engaging in guided experimentation with visuohaptic (VH) simulations. The VH experimentation included two affordances: visual cues and haptic feedback. Specifically, we analyzed the outcomes of two treatment groups with different sequences of affordance introduction. The first treatment group started with visual cues, with haptic feedback added later, while the second treatment group started with haptic feedback and added the visual cues later. We recruited 48 students who had previously taken at least one physics course. Participants completed a pre- and posttest assessment, which included both procedural and conceptual questions about friction before and after the guided experimentation task. The results show that the participants from both treatment groups benefited from using VH simulations. Both treatment groups showed statistically significant pre/post improvements in their understanding of friction. Moreover, both treatment groups showed a statistically significant increase in the conceptual understanding of friction concepts from pretest to posttest with moderate to strong effect sizes. Implications for laboratory instruction are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Abstract Terrains are a crucial component of three-dimensional scenes and are present in many Computer Graphics applications. Terrain modeling methods focus on capturing landforms in all their intricate detail, including eroded valleys arising from the interplay of varied phenomena, dendritic mountain ranges, and complex river networks. Set against this visual complexity is the need for user control over terrain features, without which designers are unable to adequately express their artistic intent. This article provides an overview of current terrain modeling and authoring techniques, organized according to three categories: procedural modeling, physically-based simulation of erosion and land formation processes, and example-based methods driven by scanned terrain data. We compare and contrast these techniques according to several criteria, specifically: the variety of achievable landforms; realism from both a perceptual and geomorphological perspective; issues of scale in terms of terrain extent and sampling precision; the different interaction metaphors and attendant forms of user-control, and computation and memory performance. We conclude with an in-depth discussion of possible research directions and outstanding technical and scientific challenges.},

  abstract = { Reconnaissance teams are charged with collecting perishable data after a natural disaster. In the field, these engineers typically record their observations through images. Each team takes many views of both exterior and interior buildings and frequently collects associated metadata that reflect information represented in images, such as global positioning system (GPS) devices, structural drawings, timestamp, and measurements. Large quantities of images with a wide variety of contents are collected. The window of opportunity is short, and engineers need to provide accurate and rich descriptions of such images before the details are forgotten. In this paper, an automated approach is developed to organize and document such scientific information in an efficient and rapid manner. Deep convolutional neural network algorithms were successfully implemented to extract robust features of key visual contents in the images. A schema is designed based on the realistic needs of field teams examining buildings. A significant number of images collected from past earthquakes were used to train robust classifiers to automatically classify the images. The classifiers and associated schema were used to automatically generate individual reports for buildings. },

For over one hundred years, hardwood lumber in North America has been graded by specially trained lumber inspectors using the National Hardwood Lumber Association (NHLA) Rules for the Inspection of Hardwood Lumber. With technology improving over time, the status quo of lumber grading is again being challenged. This paper outlines an automated lumber grading study using a Microtec Goldeneye 300 Multi-Sensor Quality Scanner™. The scanner is equipped with color cameras, dot-grid and profile lasers and an x-ray sensor to locate and classify defects at a speed of 980 linear feet per minute. The material studied was rough, kiln dried hardwood lumber of nine different commercial species. Over 1000 boards from each species were graded with the scanner and verified by a NHLA-trained human lumber inspector. This paper reviews the performance of the scanner and highlights its accuracy by species and individual grades within that species. Across the entire volume of boards scanned, the automated grading system was 99.50% on-value and 92.22% on-grade accurate.},

Thus, the speed of the 3D printing processes can generally be increased by using time-efficient object orientations. This paper presents a novel method for speeding-up printing processes that employs maximally efficient orientations. This method finds an orientation for the object that minimizes the number of disconnected components and the distance between the disconnected components that remain, thereby minimizing the time needed for the printer head to traverse empty areas. The method also considers the height of the printed object, its trapped volume, and the number of connected components in each layer. Our novel algorithm considers all four criteria, each weighted according to printer-specific and experimentally-obtained parameters. Preliminary trials demonstrate that this methodology can decrease printing times on fused deposition printers to 45% of that of current state of the art algorithms.",

	abstract={Structural analysis is a foundational statics concept for students majoring in mechanical engineering, civil engineering, and engineering technology, among others. However, the mathematical emphasis of a typical statics courses lies in algebraic calculations, matrices, vectors, and sometimes deemphasizes student understanding of the behavior of the overall structure as a system, focusing instead on its individual elements. This study investigates students' conceptual understanding of forces acting and reacting in a truss structure as well as their corresponding representations in the form of Free Body Diagrams (FBDs). Our findings suggest that students primarily demonstrated partially coherent answers suggesting that they may hold some misconceptions about truss behavior. The most prevalent error was that students failed to account for the mutual (equal and opposite) forces between connected bodies that were separated for analysis. Based on our findings we propose the design of a learning experience that combines principles of embodied learning with the affordances of visuohaptic simulations to address students' misconceptions.},

Then the configuration phase provides a robust algorithm to pack the components for an efficient print job. Our approach has been tested on both simulated models and real-world printed objects. Our results show that the framework can reduce print time by up to 65% (fused deposition modeling, or FDM) and 36% (stereolithography, or SLA) on average and diminish material consumption by up to 35% (FDM) and 10% (SLA) on consumer printers, while also providing more accurate objects.},

Subduction of one plate causes large-scale asymmetry while their layered composition (or stratigraphy) explains the multi-scale folded strata observed on real terrains. We introduce a novel interactive modeling technique to generate visually plausible, large scale terrains that capture these phenomena. Our method draws on both geological knowledge for consistency and on sculpting systems for user interaction. The user is provided hands-on control on the shape and motion of tectonic plates, represented using a new geologically-inspired model for the Earth crust. The model captures their volume preserving and complex folding behaviors under collision, causing mountains to grow. It generates a volumetric uplift map representing the growth rate of subsurface layers. Erosion and uplift movement are jointly simulated to generate the terrain. The stratigraphy allows us to render folded strata on eroded cliffs. We validated the usability of our sculpting interface through a user study, and compare the visual consistency of the earth crust model with geological simulation results and real terrains.},

pages={2560-2573},
abstract={Surface remeshing is a key component in many geometry processing applications. The typical goal consists in finding a mesh that is (1) geometrically faithful to the original geometry, (2) as coarse as possible to obtain a low-complexity representation and (3) free of bad elements that would hamper the desired application (e.g., the minimum interior angle is above an application-dependent threshold). Our algorithm is designed to address all three optimization goals simultaneously by targeting prescribed bounds on approximation error $\delta$ , minimal interior angle $\theta$ and maximum mesh complexity $N$ (number of vertices). The approximation error bound $\delta$ is a hard constraint, while the other two criteria are modeled as optimization goals to guarantee feasibility. Our optimization framework applies carefully prioritized local operators in order to greedily search for the coarsest mesh with minimal interior angle above $\theta$ and approximation error bounded by $\delta$ . Fast runtime is enabled by a local approximation error estimation, while implicit feature preservation is obtained by specifically designed vertex relocation operators. Experiments show that for reasonable angle bounds ( $\theta \leq 35^\circ$ ) our approach delivers high-quality meshes with implicitly preserved features (no tagging required) and better balances between geometric fidelity, mesh complexity and element quality than the state-of-the-art.},

Barcode characterizes an image by encoding the distribution of vertical lines into a binary descriptor: in each vertical stripe of an image, if any vertical line exists the corresponding bit is set to 1, otherwise 0. For localization, our approach uses a database of geolocated images, each having its Barcode precomputed during a preprocessing stage. In the run time, we first generate the binary descriptor for each image and then use the descriptor to find the location in the database via Hamming distance metric. For turn classification, we train a deep neural network that uses a set of Barcodes from consecutive images to classify turns (left, right, straight, and stationary). We show that Barcode extraction can be done at 100-1000~Hz, localization at 10~kHz, and turn classification at 1~kHz. We show compelling experimental results on KITTI dataset and other sequences captured near Harvard and Purdue campuses.},

abstract = {Abstract We present a novel approach for style retargeting to non-humanoid characters by allowing extracted stylistic features from one character to be added to the motion of another character with a different body morphology. We introduce the concept of groups of body parts (GBPs), for example, the torso, legs and tail, and we argue that they can be used to capture the individual style of a character motion. By separating GBPs from a character, the user can define mappings between characters with different morphologies. We automatically extract the motion of each GBP from the source, map it to the target and then use a constrained optimization to adjust all joints in each GBP in the target to preserve the original motion while expressing the style of the source. We show results on characters that present different morphologies to the source motion from which the style is extracted. The style transfer is intuitive and provides a high level of control. For most of the examples in this paper, the definition of GBP takes around 5 min and the optimization about 7 min on average. For the most complicated examples, the definition of three GBPs and their mapping takes about 10 min and the optimization another 30 min.},

  ABSTRACT={Multi-scale models can facilitate whole plant simulations by linking gene networks, protein synthesis, metabolic pathways, physiology, and growth. Whole plant models can be further integrated with ecosystem, weather, and climate models to predict how various interactions respond to environmental perturbations. These models have the potential to fill in missing mechanistic details and generate new hypotheses to prioritize directed engineering efforts. Outcomes will potentially accelerate improvement of crop yield, sustainability, and increase future food security. It is time for a paradigm shift in plant modeling, from largely isolated efforts to a connected community that takes advantage of advances in high performance computing and mechanistic understanding of plant processes. Tools for guiding future crop breeding and engineering, understanding the implications of discoveries at the molecular level for whole plant behavior, and improved prediction of plant and ecosystem responses to the environment are urgently needed. The purpose of this perspective is to introduce Crops in silico (cropsinsilico.org), an integrative and multi-scale modeling platform, as one solution that combines isolated modeling efforts toward the generation of virtual crops, which is open and accessible to the entire plant biology community. The major challenges involved both in the development and deployment of a shared, multi-scale modeling platform, which are summarized in this prospectus, were recently identified during the first Crops in silico Symposium and Workshop.},

abstract = {Abstract We present a novel system for the interactive modeling of developmental climbing plants with an emphasis on efficient control and plausible physics response. A plant is represented by a set of connected anisotropic particles that respond to the surrounding environment and to their inner state. Each particle stores biological and physical attributes that drive growth and plant adaptation to the environment such as light sensitivity, wind interaction, and physical obstacles. This representation allows for the efficient modeling of external effects that can be induced at any time without prior analysis of the plant structure. In our framework we exploit this representation to provide powerful editing capabilities that allow to edit a plant with respect to its structure and its environment while maintaining a biologically plausible appearance. Moreover, we couple plants with Lagrangian fluid dynamics and model advanced effects, such as the breaking and bending of branches. The user can thus interactively drag and prune branches or seed new plants in dynamically changing environments. Our system runs in real-time and supports up to 20 plant instances with 25k branches in parallel. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through a number of interactive experiments, including modeling and animation of different species of climbing plants on complex support structures.},

  abstract={Architectural models have always played an important role in computer graphics, virtual environments, and urban planning; due to the size, detail and complexity of such models. Creating detailed and realistic buildings needs time and extensive coding as well as significant domain expertise. Observing the content creation problem and the challenges of procedural modeling, we identified and developed a generalized proceduralization framework, that converts existing 3D urban models into an easy to manipulate procedural form. Our proceduralization framework for urban spaces allows re-use of existing models in various formats by first conducting shape processing methods to find and exploit the repetitions and similarities to reveal the hidden high-level structural information, and then by using grammar discovery methods on those components to extract a representative grammar of the model. Additionally, we have proposed applications of such procedural representations, including completion of point cloud models and structure-aware synthesis tools for procedural editing.},

  abstract  = {Computer simulation of tree development can provide important insight into real world tree behavior. Numerous models have been developed ranging from simple equations to complicated 3D geometrical models that allow for simulation of acquisition and allocation of carbohydrates. We introduce IMapple (Interactively Modeled Apple), a functional structural apple tree model that builds on the source-sink model of L-peach. Our model integrates accurate biological functionality, as well as high quality visual geometric details. The details are modeled by using subdivision surfaces that allows for fast generation of high precision geometry and direct illumination of leaves is simulated by sampling the sky and the sun trajectory. The main advantage of the IMapple is that allows for an interactive experimentation by the way it manages data. Input data can be provided interactively or by using real-world samples and the model responds immediately. Alternatively, hypothesized data can be input by drawing functional dependencies, for example the resource assimilation rate as a function of light interception can be input by drawing a graph showing the real or assumed relationship. Moreover, our model supports a variety of convenient user interactions, such as branch pruning and flower thinning. We have collected a large data set over the last few years that serves as inputs to our model. IMapple is fast and it allows for interactive or near-interactive simulation of apple trees. For example, a ten years-old tree grown with a time step of one hour can be simulated in under five minutes using a PC. Moreover, our system allows for a simulation of multiple trees and their mutual interaction. We demonstrate the results by simulating growth and fruiting of Golden Delicious apple trees realistically with data collected from a planting at the Purdue Meigs research farm.},

Our framework captures the pattern hierarchy of the input model into a split tree data representation. A context-free split grammar, supporting a hierarchical nesting of procedural rules, is extracted from the tree, which establishes the base of our interactive procedural editing engine. We show the application of our approach to a variety of architectural structures obtained by procedurally editing web-sourced models. The grammar generation takes a few minutes even for the most complex input and synthesis is fully interactive for buildings composed of up to 200k polygons.},

We introduce environmental objects that extend an input object geometry with a set of procedural effects that defines how the object reacts to the environment, and by a set of scalar fields that defines the influence of the object over of the environment. The user controls the scene by modifying environmental variables, such as temperature or humidity fields. The scene definition is hierarchical: objects can be grouped and their behaviours can be set at each level of the hierarchy. Our per object definition allows us to optimize and accelerate the effects computation, which also enables us to generate large scenes with many geometric details at a very high level of detail. In our implementation, a complex urban scene of 10 000 m2, represented with details of less than 1 cm, can be locally modified and entirely regenerated in a few seconds.},

Interpreting these soil descriptions is a skill that requires considerable practice and experience. While writing a soil description is straightforward, recreating a visual representation of a soil profile from a written description is very difficult. So far, there is no generalized approach for translating written or tabular soil descriptions into visual representations. We propose a novel procedural modeling approach inspired by procedural models commonly used in the field of computer graphics. Our framework takes tabular soil morphological data (i.e., soil profile descriptions) as textual input and translates it into visual features based on parametric models. These models can be used to generate two-dimensional soil profiles or to generate three-dimensional interactive models that allow rotation, scaling, and other forms of visual explorations. The procedural modeling technique enables the user to generate the soil profile visual representation with only a small amount of data. The images do not need to be stored because they are generated as needed.",

  abstract = {Abstract At large scale, landscapes result from the combination of two major processes: tectonics which generate the main relief through crust uplift, and weather which accounts for erosion. This paper presents the first method in computer graphics that combines uplift and hydraulic erosion to generate visually plausible terrains. Given a user-painted uplift map, we generate a stream graph over the entire domain embedding elevation information and stream flow. Our approach relies on the stream power equation introduced in geology for hydraulic erosion. By combining crust uplift and stream power erosion we generate large realistic terrains at a low computational cost. Finally, we convert this graph into a digital elevation model by blending landform feature kernels whose parameters are derived from the information in the graph. Our method gives high-level control over the large scale dendritic structures of the resulting river networks, watersheds, and mountains ridges.},
