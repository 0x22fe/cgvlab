  abstract = {Abstract In this study, we analyzed students’ reasoning and explanations of friction concepts before and after engaging in guided experimentation with visuohaptic (VH) simulations. The VH experimentation included two affordances: visual cues and haptic feedback. Specifically, we analyzed the outcomes of two treatment groups with different sequences of affordance introduction. The first treatment group started with visual cues, with haptic feedback added later, while the second treatment group started with haptic feedback and added the visual cues later. We recruited 48 students who had previously taken at least one physics course. Participants completed a pre- and posttest assessment, which included both procedural and conceptual questions about friction before and after the guided experimentation task. The results show that the participants from both treatment groups benefited from using VH simulations. Both treatment groups showed statistically significant pre/post improvements in their understanding of friction. Moreover, both treatment groups showed a statistically significant increase in the conceptual understanding of friction concepts from pretest to posttest with moderate to strong effect sizes. Implications for laboratory instruction are also discussed.},
